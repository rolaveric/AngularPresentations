# Presentation 1 - Introduction to AngularJS
A short introduction to AngularJS that introduces:

* 2 way data binding
* Dependency injection
* Directives

The purpose is not to explain in depth how to use these things, but more to give those with no experience with AngularJS some context for the terms that get used.

For example, a 'directive' is a new HTML element and/or attribute that you can create custom behaviour for.
