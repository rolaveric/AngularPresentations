# Presentation 1a (Nextgen) - Introduction to AngularJS
A short introduction to AngularJS, geared towards Nextgen.net developers, that presents the message:
"AngularJS makes your code simpler, your work easier, and your product better"

Topics:
* Section 1 - AngularJS is awesome
** Common pain points in our day-to-day work
*** Verbose XSLT
*** Complex DOM manipulation (eg. Repeating tables)
*** Untestable code (global dependencies, etc.)
** Enter AngularJS
*** Directives extend HTML
*** 2 way data binding makes DOM manipulation simple
*** Dependency injection keeps everything loosely coupled
* Section 2 - Live Development
** Reproduce "Loan Portion" form in AngularJS
* Section 3 - What can we do with it?
** Make use of more third-party software
** Thin out the server code, so we can replace it

The purpose is not to explain in depth how to use these things, but more to give those with no experience with AngularJS some context for the terms that get used.

For example, a 'directive' is a new HTML element and/or attribute that you can create custom behaviour for.
